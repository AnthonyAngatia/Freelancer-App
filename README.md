# Freelancer-App
Mobile application class project

The application is made with Android Studio and Written in Java.
It uses a backend written in php using the Laravel framework Link:(https://github.com/search?q=Freelancer_API_V1)  and mysql database.

## How it works
> We have 2 users of the application:
> 1. Freelancer-Uploads the  services he/she offers e.g Plumber.
> 2. Client-Seeking for a service e.g Repair my pipe.

> The application aims to connect a client to a freelancer. The client can access the freelancers contacts from the app and approach the freelancer using other means or can send a request via the application to the freelancer.
